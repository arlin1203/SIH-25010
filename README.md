## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Theme
Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution
Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development focuses on improving farming practices, using modern technologies to increase crop yield and food quality. FoodTech applies innovation in processing, storage, and distribution to reduce waste and ensure safe nutrition. Rural development supports villages with better infrastructure, education, and livelihoods. Together, they aim to boost the economy and improve the quality of life in rural areas.

## Technical Approach
Use of IoT, sensors, and drones for smart farming.

Biotechnology and precision farming for higher crop yield.

Cold storage, packaging, and supply chain systems in FoodTech.

Digital platforms, e-governance, and renewable energy for rural growth.

## Feasibility and Viability
Feasibility: Possible due to government support, technology availability, and growing demand for safe food.

Viability: Sustainable in the long term as it improves farmer income, reduces food waste, and supports rural economy growth.
## Impact and Benefits
Impact:
Improves agricultural productivity and food security.
Reduces food wastage through better storage and processing.
Strengthens rural economy by creating jobs and entrepreneurship.
Promotes sustainable farming and eco-friendly practices.
Benefits:
Farmers earn better income and market access.
Consumers get safer, nutritious, and affordable food.
Villages gain improved infrastructure and quality of life.
Long-term growth in national economy and self-reliance in food production.

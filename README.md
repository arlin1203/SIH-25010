Problem Title


SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers

Problem Description

A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.
Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved
Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
Market price tracking.
Voice support for low-literate users.
Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

Small and marginal farmers
Agricultural extension officers
Government agriculture departments
NGOs and cooperatives
Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

Proposed Solution

Develop a Smart Crop Advisory System using AI, IoT, and mobile technologies to provide personalized, real-time agricultural advice. The solution will integrate soil health data, weather forecasts, and market trends into a farmer-friendly mobile app or chatbot with multilingual and voice support. This system will empower small farmers to adopt modern practices, reduce dependency on unreliable sources, and improve overall productivity and income.

Technical Approach

Technologies Used: Python/Java for backend, React Native/Flutter for mobile app, TensorFlow/PyTorch for AI models, IoT sensors for soil and weather data, and cloud platforms (AWS/Azure/GCP) for scalability.

Methodology:

Collect soil, weather, and crop data.
Train AI models for crop recommendation, fertilizer guidance, and pest/disease detection.
Build multilingual mobile app with chatbot and voice assistant features.
Integrate APIs for weather forecasts and market prices.
Pilot test with farmers and continuously improve based on feedback.

Feasibility and Viability

Feasibility: Supported by government schemes, growing mobile penetration in rural areas, and availability of agri-tech tools.
Challenges: Digital literacy barriers, connectivity issues, and initial adoption resistance.
Strategies: Simple UI with voice support, offline features for low-network areas, awareness campaigns, and partnership with local extension officers.
Viability: Long-term sustainability ensured through government/NGO collaboration, subscription models for agri-services, and scalable cloud-based infrastructure.

Impact and Benefits

Impact: Improved decision-making, higher yields, reduced input costs, and sustainable farming practices.
Benefits:
Social: Better livelihoods and empowerment of rural farmers.
Economic: Higher farmer income, reduced dependency on middlemen, and stronger rural economy.
Environmental: Reduced overuse of fertilizers and pesticides, conservation of soil and water resources.
